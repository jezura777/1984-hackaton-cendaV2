1. arm chip
2. the transmitting circuit can be powered from the energy that anthena recieves (research needs to be done)
3. throw out the 3d printing (just single board in a piece of adhesion should be enought)
4. all sensors on one board
5. the solar panel would need to be under big chunk of glass (for protection from steps or vandalism)
6. could I power the whole thing just from the anthena?
